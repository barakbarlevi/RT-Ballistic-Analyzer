This part of the project deals with the real-time task which sends the track data, from the client side of a unix socket to the server side which runs on the host. Itâ€™s assumed that this data had already been filtered and associated with a single ballistic target. The file being sent is, in this case, an output file of the 6-DOF simulation described later in this work, and it was loaded to the target machine in advance. The real-time cyclic task sends a message on a socket in constant periodicity.
