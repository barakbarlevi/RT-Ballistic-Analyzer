This part of the project deals with the real-time task which sends the track data from the client side of a unix socket to the server side running on the host. Itâ€™s assumed that this data had already been filtered and associated with a single ballistic target, and saved to a .asc file. The file being sent is, in this case, an output file of this project's revised 6DOF version of [CADAC's 3 stage booster](https://github.com/missiondesignsolutions/CADAC/tree/main/ROCKET6G). It has to be loaded to the target machine in advance. The real-time cyclic task sends a message on a socket in constant periodicity.
