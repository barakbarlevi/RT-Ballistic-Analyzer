This part of the project combines its other two key parts, which are: a real-time task that feeds in detection data simulating a generic sensor, and the fast ballistic trajectories 6DOF that can be set with mid-air initial conditions. The 'MOJO' ballistic analyzer integrates them, and runs the logic that compares their outcomes to arrive at a practical conclusion. 

Some nomenclature for the analyzer:\
